**Predicting Satellite Collisions with Real Orbital Data**

---

## The Problem

With the rapid increase in the number of satellites and mega-constellations being launched, the risk of satellite collisions in Earth's orbit is higher than ever before. A single collision can generate thousands of debris fragments, threatening other satellites, critical infrastructure, and even human life in space. Traditional collision prediction tools are often complex, not user-friendly, or inaccessible for students, researchers, and small organizations.
